# shortcutlab

Master your favorite application shortcuts in an one stop web application.

## Motivation

Open source and free application for training shortcuts for all applications of the world!

## Getting Started

This application can be accessed on [http://ceduliocezar.github.io/shortcutlab](http://ceduliocezar.github.io/shortcutlab/)

- Clone this repo on using Git or simply download it as zip file.

- Open the file [index.html](index.html) on an web browser of your preference.

## Create your own lab

Even tough shortculab has a list of pre defined labs the chances are that we don't support your application so far.

With this in mind you can create your own lab that meets your specific needs using the [sample lab](labs/sample_1.0.0_all.lab) as example and use it during your training session.

Even better if you submit a pull request introducing your newly created lab of your awesome application.
